Hi, I'm Maya Scott-Richardson. I am a Ph.D candidate in Pathobiology specializing in Spatial Epidemiology as apart of the  Geographic Information Science and Spatial Epidemiology (GISSA) and the Modeling for Disease Control Improvement. My research interests include Social Epidemiology, Spatial Epidemiology, Public Health, Environmental Health, and Population Health, and Health Disparties. I am currently looking for an environmental and social epidemiology post-doc. My research goal is to work with vulnerable populations and health disparities associated with poor and unjust social and environmental conditions.

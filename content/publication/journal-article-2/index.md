abstract: This repository contains R codes that can be used to perform generalized linear models (GLM) and data visualization on low birth weight data and other contributing factors. In these codes, you will be able to learn code that can aggregate data categories; filter and select data from the dataframe; run GLM models; and create table and plots for your results. Please use R Markdown when viewing these codes.

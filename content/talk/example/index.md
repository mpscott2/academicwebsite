abstract: Chronic, long-term exposure to arsenic can result in adverse health outcomes, but the effects of sources are difficult to assess epidemiologically. Arsenic concentrations accrued by people can be measured using toenail samples and can serve as a proxy for chronic arsenic exposure. The objective of this project is to assess the relationship between environmental arsenic concentrations and chronic arsenic exposure among residents in Escambia and Santa Rosa counties, Florida. We will assess the levels of arsenic collected from toenails of residents in our study area and from their residential water supply, along with data pertaining to demographics and occupational history, and daily arsenic intake questionnaire collected from the same residents. We will analyze the data to determine the relationship between daily arsenic exposure in private well water, previously determined soil and groundwater contamination levels, and human activity. The importance of this study is to quantify the relationship between the variability of chronic arsenic in the environment and its past use in agricultural and industrial activities (legacy effect). Our work will allow us to quantify the relationship between arsenic in people and the environment.
